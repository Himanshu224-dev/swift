# 100 Days of Swift ðŸš€
Welcome!
This repository documents my journey through the 100 Days of Swift challenge. Each day, Iâ€™ll be learning new concepts in Swift and contributing code examples, projects, and notes based on what I learn.
ðŸ“… About the Challenge
100 Days of Swift is a self-paced coding challenge created by Paul Hudson at Hacking with Swift. The goal is to spend at least one hour a day learning Swift for 100 days, building a strong foundation in iOS development.
ðŸ’¡ Why Am I Doing This?
	â€¢	To master Swift programming and iOS development
	â€¢	To build a portfolio of code and projects
	â€¢	To stay consistent and accountable
